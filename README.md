## Hello! I'm Renan 👋

Developer in training and curious by nature. I like to understand/learn how things work and turn that into well-written code.

I’ve been diving into Kotlin, Python, and AI, with a focus on building solutions that go beyond the basics. I'm always testing ideas, breaking my head over problems, and learning through the process.

My mission? To grow as a developer, build things that truly make sense, constantly learn new things, and keep evolving my skills and knowledge. 👊
